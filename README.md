# Hand_written_digit_recognizer
This is first my Machine learning project,this project is Hand_written_digit_recognizer which is designed as an application of Convolutional Neural network,in order to know more please refer the readme file..

# Introduction 
Hand written digit classification is CNN trained over very famous MNIST dataset which contains 6000 images each of pixel 28 X 28, after training over the datset the network achieved a great accuracy over cross validation set

# REQUIREMENTS 
1. Python 3.6 or above 

# Steps to run the application
1. Download the ZIP file of the project
2. After downloading,run the GUI.py file which will introduce the user with the graphical user interface of the project where you can draw the digit and see the results..
